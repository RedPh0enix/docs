What is OpenPlotter?
####################

There are people who buy boats but there are also people who build them, why not build your own electronics too? OpenPlotter is a combination of software and hardware to be used as navigational aid on small and medium boats. It is also a complete on-board home automation system. It is open-source, low-cost, low-consumption and it works on ARM computers like the Raspberry Pi or any computer running a Linux Debian derivative. Its design is modular, so you just have to implement what your boat needs. Do it yourself.

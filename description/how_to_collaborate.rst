How to collaborate
##################

	Everything takes **time**, **money** and **monkeys**. You need a lot from any two groups and a little from the third. An increase in any one reduces the requirement for the other two. Change occurs when one of those three change.

	-- Moe's Law (Navigatrix project)â€‹

**Time**

Download and install OpenPlotter and test and test and test ... Report bugs and request new features in `OpenMarine forums <http://forum.openmarine.net/>`_. Spread the word among your friends in ports and forums.

**Money**

This project is financed by `selling related products <https://shop.openmarine.net/>`_ or by `voluntary contributions <https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=3J8V5AT6M74L4>`_.

**Monkeys**

	Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.

	-- Ernest Shackleton

Translations
*************

If you want to help translate the software into your language, create an account on the Crowdin platform and edit `the project <https://crowdin.com/project/openplotter>`_.


Documentation
*************

We will no longer maintain translations, just the source in English, we tried but failed. This project is too dynamic and even maintaining this documentation is a hard job. Translators coordination is not an option either.

If you want to help us maintain this documentation, let us know what your intentions are in `the forum <http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16>`_ to coordinate. The best way to do this is to fork `this repository GitHub <https://github.com/openplotter/docs>`_ and push your commits. If you are not familiar with GitHub, do not worry, send us your contributions to `the forum <http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16>`_.

**Guidelines**

-  We need schematic and concise documentation just for reference. We do not want manuals, tutorials or detailed "How-to's". That makes people free to generate their detailed manuals, tutorials or videos for newbies in their language. Remember, this is a reference book, not a tutorial. Be brief and concise.

- A picture is worth a thousand words. In order to keep the same style use this tool to make screenshots:

	.. parsed-literal::

		sudo apt install gnome-screenshot

	with these settings:

	.. image:: img/screenshot.png

- English is not our main language and there will be a lot of grammar mistakes, please help us to solve it too.

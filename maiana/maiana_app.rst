MAIANA AIS Transponder
######################

.. image:: img/maiana1.png

The main difference between MAIANA™ and all commercial AIS devices is that it is a self-contained unit, all AIS and GNSS circuits are located in the antenna housing. MAIANA™ receives GNSS and AIS data on both channels and can be enabled as a class B transponder. The transponder outputs just over 2 Watts (+33dBm).

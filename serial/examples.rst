Connecting a USB-RS422 converter
********************************

You probably still have some devices onboard that use the old NMEA 0183 protocol. Most commercial plotters collect data from all onboard devices and send it through an RS422 output. To connect these devices to OpenPlotter, you need any inexpensive USB-RS422 converter. 

Some notes about wiring
***********************

typical RS422 device looks like the one below:
.. image:: img/serial_rs422A.png

there are normally 4 or 5 connections. TX+, TX-, RX+, RX-, GND

Normally you don't need ground and you would connect TX of the chart plotter/VHF etc to the RX of the RS422 to USB device and vice versa.  However, there is little consistency between different devices as to what is possitve and what is negative - so if the TX+ connected to the RX+ does not work, try connecting to the RX-

Consult your device manual to find the baud rate, if you can't find the baud rate then usually, if the device is older and pre-AIS the baud rate may be 4800, leter devices that may have or accept AIS will be 38400.  use an absolute value if Auto does not work

Input data
==========

To obtain data from these converters, follow the same steps as for connecting the GPS in the examples of the previous sections of this chapter. Below are the summarized steps.

Enter an ``alias`` and select the type of ``data``:

.. image:: img/serial_rs4222.png

Create a signal K connection:

.. image:: img/serial_rs4223.png
.. image:: img/serial_rs4224.png
.. image:: img/serial_rs4225.png

Check the Signal K connection has been made:

.. image:: img/serial_rs4226.png

And check OpenCPN to make sure there is a connection to the Signal K server:

You should now be ready to get NMEA 0183 data from your boat.

Input + output data
===================

Now that you are getting NMEA 0183 data from your boat, you may also want to send some NMEA 0183 data generated in OpenPlotter to your boat. The classic case is to let openplotter control your autopilot. Let's see how to configure your route in OpenCPN and send data to the autopilot using the same USB-RS422 converter.

You have to create a UDP connection in OpenCPN to send data to Signal K server. Select ``Network``, ``Protocol``: UDP, ``Address``: 0.0.0.0, ``DataPort``: 10119 (or any unused UDP port on your system), ``User Comment``: opencpnOUT, uncheck ``Receive input on this Port``, check ``Output on this port``, transmit only sentences RMB and APB in ``Output filtering``:

.. image:: img/serial_rs4227.png
.. image:: img/serial_rs4228.png

.. warning::
	Allowing only RMB and APB sentences in the output is important to avoid data loops in your system.

Now you have to create a connection in Signal K server to get data from OpenCPN. Login to the Signal K server, go to :menuselection:`Server --> Connections` and click on ``Add``:

.. image:: img/serial_rs4229.png

Set ``Input Type``: NMEA 0183, ``ID``: opencpnOUT, ``NMEA 0183 Source``: UDP, ``Port``: 10119 (or whatever you have set in OpenCPN), ``Sentence Event``: autopilot, ``Ignored Sentences``: RMB,APB and Click ``Apply``:

.. image:: img/serial_rs42210.png
.. image:: img/serial_rs42211.png

.. warning::
	Ignoring sentences RMB and APB is important to avoid data loops in your system.

Finally, you have to edit your device connection to specify what data should be sent to your boat via the USB-RS422 converter. Go to :menuselection:`Server --> Connections` and click on your device connection, in this case ``rs422``:

.. image:: img/serial_rs42212.png

Set ``Output Events``: autopilot, ``Ignored Sentences``: RMB,APB and Click ``Apply``:

.. image:: img/serial_rs42213.png
.. image:: img/serial_rs42214.png

.. warning::
	Ignoring sentences RMB and APB is important to avoid data loops in your system.

``Restart`` Signal K server and you are done:

.. image:: img/serial_rs42215.png
.. image:: img/serial_rs42216.png

Activate a route in OpenCPN and you will start sending data to your autopilot.

Connecting a USB-CAN converter
******************************

This tutorial is for the *Actisense NGT-1*, the *OpenMarine CAN-USB Stick* (discontinued) and the *CANable* devices.

Input data
==========

To get data from your NMEA 2000 network you have to select the device, enter an ``alias`` and select NMEA 2000 in ``data`` field. Finally press ``Apply`` and the device will be marked blue:

.. image:: img/serial_can1.png
.. image:: img/serial_can2.png

Then go to ``Connections`` tab, select the device and click on ``Add to CAN Bus``:

.. image:: img/serial_can3.png

If you are using a *CANable* device click on ``MANUAL`` and go to :ref:`CAN Bus<can>` chapter to learn how to configure this device.

If you are using an *Actisense NGT-1* or an *OpenMarine CAN-USB Stick* (discontinued) device, select the ``Baud Rate`` (usually 115200) and click on ``AUTO``.

.. image:: img/serial_can4.png

The device will be marked blue and you are done:

.. image:: img/serial_can5.png

Open the ``CAN Bus`` app to confirm that the device has been added to the ``CAN-USB`` tab:

.. image:: img/serial_can6.png

And go to Signal K server to confirm that the connection has been made:

.. image:: img/serial_can7.png

Check OpenCPN to make sure there is a connection to the Signal K server and you are getting data from your NMEA 2000 network:

.. image:: img/serial10.png

Input + output data
===================

If you have any sensor in OpenPlotter sending data to the Signal K server, you can use the same USB-CAN converter to send this data to your NMEA 2000 network.

To protect your network, the *Actisense NGT-1* and the *OpenMarine CAN-USB Stick* (discontinued) devices have most PGNs blocked for transmission. On *CANable* devices, PGNs transmission is not blocked.

To unblock the PGNs you want to send to your NMEA 2000 network, go to ``CAN Bus`` app, select the device and click on ``Open device TX PGNs``:

.. image:: img/serial_can8.png

Enable the PGNs you want to unblock and click ``Apply``:

.. image:: img/serial_can9.png

.. note::
	If you see this message: *The list of enabled PGNs is empty, you may need to try a different baudrate or reset your device to 115200 bauds*, click on ``CAN-USB Setup`` to fix your device baud rate.

Click ``OK`` to write changes to the device:

.. image:: img/serial_can10.png

Finally, you have to tell the Signal K server what PGNs you need to convert from Signal K format to NMEA 2000 format (for any device model). To do this we use the plugin ``Signal K to NMEA 2000``. Click on ``SK â†’ NMEA 2000`` and you will be directed to the configuration page of this plugin:

.. image:: img/serial_can11.png

Enable ``Active`` and the desired PGNs:

.. image:: img/serial_can12.png

Click on ``Submit`` at the bottom of the page and you are done:

AvNav Installer
###############

**Under construction...**

Packet: openplotter-avnav

 

Purpose

This app should install Avnav (a web chart plotter app) on openplotter based systems.

Another feature is to activate, deactivate, stop, start and restart the Avnav server (systemd).

 

The app does listen to port 8080. (Itâ€˜s the same as opening Signal K admin ui in the browser. The only difference is that Signal K listens to port 3000 instead of 8080.)

 

The communication is completly managed by openplotter (similar to opencpn). So no settings in the  ~/avnav/data/avnav_server.xml file are needed.

Processes and Ports
____________________

AvNav has a main process ("avnav") that handles all the NMEA data and server functions.
It has one port for the web access (default: 8080).
To handle o-charts there is an additional process (controlled and started by avnav)
that has an own port for the access to those charts (default 8082).
To run updates from the AvNav web app there is an additionaly avnavupdater 
process that is running independently from avnav and again has an own port for the web access
(default: 8085).
You can modify the ports at the settings tab if they interfere with others
applications you have installed. OpenPlotter will check this and warn you accordingly.
